# semi-structured given project

#SSD Project

As a group project, you will be developing a web app that will serve as a
management system for either a CS department, a Library, or a Movie theater.
You will be required to store all data as XML files and perform CRUD operations
using XQuery and any other necessary tools.
You will need to choose one of the following scenarios:
• CS department: Your web app should allow the user to perform tasks such
as adding, updating, and deleting records of students and faculty.
Additionally, the system should be able to generate reports based on
specific search criteria.
• Library: Your web app should allow the user to perform tasks such as
adding, updating, and deleting records of books. Additionally, the system
should be able to generate reports based on specific search criteria.
• Movie theater: Your web app should allow the user to perform tasks such
as adding, updating, and deleting records of movie showtimes and tickets.
Additionally, the system should be able to generate reports based on
specific search criteria.

Your web app should display the stored data in a proper formatting and eye-
friendly manner. It should have the following features:

• Search and filter functionality: the app should provide users with the ability
to search and filter records based on various criteria such as name, author,
genre, date, etc.
• Notification system: the app should be able to send notifications to users
based on specific events such as book/movie returns, overdue items, or
ticket availability.
Overall, this project will challenge you to apply your knowledge of XML and
XQuery to develop a real-world web app that displays data in a proper formatting
and eye-friendly manner.

Good luck!
